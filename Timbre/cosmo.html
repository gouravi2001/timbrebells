      <h1>Cosmo Melody</h1>
      <p>
        Ever heard of songs sung by a local artisan? Have you sung a song on someone’s wedding? Have you at least once noticed your mom singing in the kitchen? Have you given a thought to the traditional music of other countries or ancient music genres, lost music genres and kinds? You must have wondered at least once how vast music is, how deep it is, what is the history of every genre, what are the psychological effects of listening to a particular genre, what are different kinds of instruments used, what is the story behind a particular song, how diverse if any country’s music? Are you having a burning desire in you to cure the people through the lyrics you write?
Many of us have an urge for learning about other cultures without wasting a lot of money, by traveling to that particular country. Some of us have a desire to show their family traditional music or regional music or express their stories through music to the world. How about we get something where all these questions will be answered and wishes will be fulfilled…
You are on the right Platform!
Come join us on our journey, where you will enter into a new world of music.
Our Flagship Program ‘Cosmo Melody welcomes everyone, be it the person of any age, any region or be your music belongs to any genre or kind (traditional, regional, etc). It aims to develop interest and broaden the reach of every genre and kind of music through blogs, research, articles, arts, etc.

      <h1>Swaragini</h1>
      <p>
        From Ragas to various types of thatas, Indian Classical Music carries the magic to spellbound millions of people. It’s a hidden treasure with benefits such as improving concentration, calming minds, stabilizing health, and many other strong effects on mental and physical health.
Swaragini aims at attracting people towards rich Indian Classical Music and making them take a step towards learning it. We especially want youngsters to take part in it enthusiastically.

Our potential listeners and practitioners are from every age group. We want each person to experience this phenomenal art as it is an all-inclusive art form.
Swaragini enlightens the audience about Indian Classical Music and its benefits, WORLDWIDE!

     <h1>Autumn Dawn</h1>
     <p>
       Music has a rich diversity, and every music genre is different from the other one. It has its
own story of birth, evolution, and revolution. Autumn Dawn is about nurturing every genre of
music be it from any place around the world or be it a hidden/lost genre or genre that’s
trending the most. Autumn Dawn focuses on treating all genres equally and promoting every
genre by telling people about its positivity and healing power. TimbreBells has its door open
for any type of music and wishes to uplift it through our ambitious project Autumn Dawn.

    <div Id="about_us">
    <h1>Open Stage</h1>
    <p>
      A world without music is like a body without a soul. Melodies are embedded everywhere, not only limited to our world but maybe it's in the entire universe. Many people are not professionals or trainees of music, they just love to sing songs casually or keep on humming music just because it makes them feel light and better. It helps in reducing stress and enjoy whatever work you are doing. Many of us want to express ourselves, our moods through music but we hesitate to do it, thinking that we are not professional or never took training in music.
Don’t worry then.
TimbreBells welcomes all those hobbyists and nonprofessional singers at Open-Stage. It invites all those people who wish to sing casually without any professionalism. Be the person of any age, any gender, from any place, we invite anyone and everyone.
